# Meet the Candidate: Lizette Villegas - Smithfield City Council

**Why Are You Running For This Position?**

I am a long-time member of this community, I am running for City Council to be a strong voice for the people who make our city. I know firsthand the struggles and the strength of our neighbors from our hardworking small business owners to our families who a safe city, more resources, and a true seat at the table. This campaign isn’t about me, it’s about us. Our future. Our families. Our community. I will be a leader that listens, understands, and delivers.

**What Previous Political Public Service Experience Or Other Experience Do You Have That Qualifies You For This Position?**

In my 15 years of my philanthropist mission, I’ve worked directly with our community at the grassroots level organizing events, supporting small businesses, and connecting residents with the resources they need. I’ve given my time freely and wholeheartedly because I believe in the potential of our city and its people. I’ve listened to the concerns of neighbors, stood alongside local entrepreneurs, and helped create spaces where families feel safe and supported. My experience isn’t just professional, t’s personal. I’ve been on the ground, doing the work, and I’m ready to bring that same dedication and community-driven perspective to City Council.

**What Do You Think Is The Most Important Issue Facing Your City Today?**

When I talk to people in our community, I hear the same things come up. The need for more affordable housing, more community events and resources, and stronger support for our small businesses to keep their doors open.

**If Elected Will You Work To Change Specific City Policies? If So Which Ones?**

I’m not running for city council with a checklist of things to change I’m running because I care deeply about Smithfield and want to represent the voices and values of the people who live here. My goal is to bring my lived experience, strong community ties, and love for this city to the table and listen first.

**What Does Your City And Its Community Mean To You?**

Cache Valley has my heart, to me it’s not just where I live, it’s where I’ve built relationships, memories, and a deep sense of purpose. This community has shaped who I am, and it’s given me so much. That’s why I’m passionate about giving back.

To me, Smithfield is more than streets and buildings it’s the people, the families, the small businesses, the school events, and local events. I want to help Smithfield grow in a way that keeps it affordable, welcoming, and full of opportunity for everyone.

**What Would You Like Your City's Residents To Know About You?**

I want the residents of Smithfield to know that I’m running for city council out of love for our community and a deep sense of civic duty. This isn’t about politics for me it’s about people. I care deeply about the future of Smithfield, and I believe in stepping up when you have something to contribute.

I’m committed to listening, learning, and working alongside our residents to make sure our city remains a place where families can thrive, businesses can grow, and everyone feels included and supported. I’m here to serve not to make promises I can’t keep, but to be a voice for our community and to help move us forward together.
