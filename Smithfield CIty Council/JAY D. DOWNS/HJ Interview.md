# Meet the Candidate: Jay Downs

**Why Are You Running For This Position?**

The reason I am running for City Council is to ensure that the city’s infrastructure keeps pace with its current rapid growth and development. As a Fire Chief, this became and continues to be a critical issue to me. My firsthand knowledge and experience of city and county government operations, grant acquisition, and budgeting will be invaluable in addressing this issue. Another reason for running is that over the past few years, I have noticed that the State threatens what I feel is overreach, on items that I feel are under local city control. One of these items is a committee that would have the power to oversee and tell a city how to manage its individual growth.

**What Previous Political Public Service Experience Or Other Experience Do You Have That Qualifies You For This Position?**

I have served the citizens for 28 years as Fire Chief and over 36 years in the fire service. During my time as Fire Chief, I acquired the skills and knowledge in fire and EMS operations, fire, building, electrical, and zoning codes, fiscal and budget management, public safety management, emergency management, tax procedures, city and county management, grant application and administration, and the overall operations of the city. During my tenure as Fire Chief, I would attend planning and zoning meetings and city council meetings, witnessing the operations and functions of the various city councils over the years.

**What Do You Think Is The Most Important Issue Facing Your City Today?**

The overall growth of the city and the ensuring the city’s infrastructure growth keeps pace with its current rapid growth and development. Core departments such as police, Fire, EMS, public works and city administration are properly staffed and equipped to meet the current and future needs of a growing community. Smithfield has a great rec program that needs continued support for the growth it is experiencing.

**If Elected, Will You Work To Change Specific City Policies? If So, Which Ones?**

As the community is growing, there are different concerns for the various areas of the city. Methods of communication and interaction would enhance the understanding of citizens of developments in their neighborhoods. This could be done through neighborhood meetings, social media, and texting notifications.

**What Does Your City And Its Community Mean To You?**

I have been a lifelong resident of Smithfield. My wife and I have raised our family of five here in Smithfield, and we are pleased to say that our children, their spouses, and their grandchildren are still living either here in Smithfield or in the surrounding valley. I have a passion for our community and its citizens. I feel we have a cherished small-town atmosphere that we need to protect.

**What Would You Like Your City’s Residents To Know About You?**

My goal in being on the city council is to continue my service to the citizens of Smithfield by using my previous knowledge and experience for the betterment of the city and my fellow citizens. As Fire Chief, I was available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. I know what it means to be available for the citizens and their needs. As a city council person, I would continue this commitment to the community and its citizens.
