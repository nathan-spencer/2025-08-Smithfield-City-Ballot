# Meet the Candidate: Sue Hyer - Smithfield City Council

**Why Are You Running For This Position?**

I care about Smithfield. Local government is a great way to serve. Our city is growing quickly. Growth comes with challenges. I don’t want the small town charm to be lost in the growth. Before I was elected in 2021, 903 units had been approved in two Master Planned communities. I felt like that was a lot of growth in a short amount of time. I am still concerned about growth.

**What Previous Political Public Service Experience Or Other Experience Do You Have That Qualifies You For This Position?**

I have served 3 1/2 years on the city council. I am a homeowner, small business owner, tax payer and concerned citizen.

**What Do You Think Is The Most Important Issue Facing Your City Today?**

Land decisions, housing and affordable housing

**If Elected, Will You Work To Change Specific City Policies? If So, Which Ones?**

I don’t have any specific policies I would like to change. I will continue to work hard and keep my word.

**What Does Your City And Its Community Mean To You?**

I come from 3 generations of Smithfield residents. I moved to Smithfield when I was 5. My 3 sons and 2 daughter in laws and their families all live in Smithfield. I think Smithfield is a beautiful town and would not want to live anywhere else.

**What Would You Like Your City's Residents To Know About You?**

Serving on City Council has been hard. I don’t think I could have ever known what it would feel like or be like making such hard decisions. I have learned so much. The time went by so fast. I feel like I can use my experience over the last 3 1/2 years to serve another 4 year term. I feel blessed to live in Smithfield.
