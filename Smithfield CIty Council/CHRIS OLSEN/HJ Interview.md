# Meet the Candidate: Chris Olsen - Smithfield City Council

**Why Are You Running For This Position?**

As a 30-year Smithfield resident, I’m running for City Council to help preserve the small-town, neighborly feel that has defined our community. I have no political ambition—just a genuine desire to serve and support our great city and its residents.

I retired from Utah State University in October 2023, where I worked as a fire alarm, security and sound systems technician. I’ve also been self-employed for 17 years as an IT specialist for Cache Valley businesses.

As a small business owner, I would like to see more small businesses find a home in Smithfield. Unfortunately the private business sector has not been able to keep up with resident growth. That means money has to travel outside Smithfield to meet the needs of its citizens. Local growth, local government, local businesses is my goal.

**What Previous Political Public Service Experience Or Other Experience Do You Have That Qualifies You For This Position?**

I currently serve on the Smithfield Planning Commission and also serve on the General Plan Steering Committee. I also volunteer with the Smithfield City CERT (Community Emergency Response Team). I bring knowledge of building and safety codes, including IBC, NEC, NFPA 72, and NFPA 13.

I understand the commitment level needed to serve effectively on the Council and am committed to thoughtful planning, responsible budgeting, and reducing tax burdens—while meeting community needs and strengthening Smithfield traditions. I am currently the only non-incumbent candidate that currently regularly attends City Council meetings. So I think that should speak for itself.

**What Do You Think Is The Most Important Issue Facing Your City Today?**

We have several global threats that are affecting not just Smithfield, but all Utah Cities. The State is overreaching and attempting to exert too much local control.

The BUILD Executive order is meant to be a power grab and centralizes power in a committee that will tell Cities how they need to manage growth. Another related problem is we also have several "Special Authority Districts" that are being created that are a quasi-governmental Authority. It is a private organization that is chosen to be the "Authority" and they get tax payer money to be the authority and they can levy taxes themselves.

Tina Cannon, our state Auditor, has spoken about how they are not transparent with their money flow and refuse to give her information that should be required. The most scary thing about Special Authority Districts is they are not required to follow any County or City regulations.

**If Elected, Will You Work To Change Specific City Policies? If So, Which Ones?**

I will work to make sure growth does not exceed our public infrastructure. I would really like to open up our meetings with welcoming arms to our Citizens. That means stop putting a time limit on free speech. 3 minutes may not be enough time for certain topics. If there is not a huge line of people wanting to speak, then why does a 3 minute limit need to be enforced?

I am very saddened that Smithfield city has chosen to not send out mailings to owners of property adjacent to proposed rezone areas. This used to be a state requirement. I am pretty sure that most residents aren't even aware when changes are happening. It is hard for Citizens to give input if they don't even know changes are happening until it is too late. This needs to fixed.

**What Does Your City And Its Community Mean To You?**

My wife and I have lived in Smithfield for the last 30 years. Our family of 5 children is expanding quickly with just our youngest daughter living at home who will be a senior in High school in August.

Kelly & I have cherished the small town atmosphere here where neighbors genuinely care about each other. I have one beautiful grand daughter. Right now the growth is outpacing our infrastructure and is endangering that small-Town caring culture that has been a hallmark of Smithfield's caring culture.

When I'm not volunteering, you can find me playing pickleball with family & friends at Forester Acres or enjoying a round of Disc Golf.

**What Would You Like Your City's Residents To Know About You?**

I am a service-oriented team player who values listening to diverse perspectives while staying grounded in constitutional principles. When faced with important decisions, I ask: will this expand freedom and protect our God-given rights?

I care about how you as Citizens of Smithfield feel about the agenda items coming before the council to vote on. If you call me I will answer. If you text me I will return your text. If you email me you will get a response from me. I am not truly representing you if I am not willing to do that. Unfortunately many representatives don't share that same commitment level today.
